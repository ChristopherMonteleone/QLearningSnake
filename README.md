    <h1>Snake AI Project</h1>
    <p>This project focuses on developing an artificial intelligence (AI) agent capable of playing the Snake game autonomously. The project is inspired by and implemented following the lessons on Q-learning provided by Patrick Loeber in his FreeCodeCamp lesson. Employing deep reinforcement learning techniques, the agent learns to navigate the game environment, avoid collisions, and maximize its score by consuming food.</p>
    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Autonomous Gameplay</strong>: The AI agent independently navigates the Snake game, learning to improve its performance over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Adopts Q-learning strategies, enabling the agent to make decisions based on the state of the environment and the potential rewards of different actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Environment Interaction</strong>: The agent dynamically adjusts its strategy in response to the game environment, showcasing the application of reinforcement learning techniques.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Development Process:</h2>
    <p>Following the educational content provided, the development process involved learning from tutorials, developing a model architecture and state evaluation mechanism, and implementing experience replay and optimization to enhance the learning efficiency and performance of the AI agent.</p>
    <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PyTorch</strong>: For building the neural network model.</li>
        <li><strong>Python & Pygame</strong>: Used to develop the game environment and agent logic.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Project Outcome:</h2>
    <p>The project successfully demonstrates the AI agent's capability to play the Snake game with increasing proficiency, showcasing the practical application of Q-learning in creating intelligent gameplay strategies. It highlights the potential of reinforcement learning in game development.</p>
    <h2>Credits:</h2>
    <p>Special thanks to Patrick Loeber for his comprehensive and insightful tutorials on Q-learning featured on FreeCodeCamp, which have been instrumental in the development of this project.</p>
